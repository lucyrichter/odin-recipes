    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large dutch oven or pot, cook bacon over medium heat until it is crisp and browned. Once cooked, remove bacon from the pot and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add butter and diced onion into the pot and saute over medium hear until onions are tender and translucent, 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the cooked onions and garlic and cook for 1 minute, to allow the raw flour taste to cook out.</li>
        <li>Stream the chicken broth in slowly, whisking continuously, to ensure there are no clumps in your mixture. Then add the remaining chicken broth, milk and heavy cream, stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add in diced potatoes and stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil, cover and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are tender, turn down the heat to a simmer, use a potato masher (a wooden spoon or whisk will work as well) to break up the potatoes into smaller pieces. Let it simmer for 15 more minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Ladle into a bowl and top with additional bacon, green onions, sour cream and cheese to reach the ultimate loaded baked potato status. Enjoy!</li>
