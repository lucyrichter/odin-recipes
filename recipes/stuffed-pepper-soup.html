        <li>1, 15oz can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1, 14oz can of beef broth</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons of fresh parsley, chopped, set aside 1/2 teaspoon for garnish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, if you like a little spice</li>
        <li>1 cup of uncooked long grain white or brown rice</li>
        <li>For garnish: your preferred shredded cheese, I use a blend of cheddar and mozzarella</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h4>Instructions</h4></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat for a few minutes. Once oil is warm, add your beef to the pot with a pinch of salt and pepper. While cooking, break up the beef into bite sized pieces until browned. Drain excess oil and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and add in your yellow onion and bell peppers and saute until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add in your garlic and saute until fragrant, about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add your cooked ground beef back in, along with your spices and cook for a minute. Then add in your diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and beef broth. Bring to a slight boil, reduce the heat to medium low and cover. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the soup simmers, prepare the rice according to the directions listed on the package. Add the rice directly into the soup once cooked.</li>
        <li>Top with your preferred cheese, garnish with parsley, and enjoy!</li>
